# UpgradingACrealityCR-10V1ToUseItIn2025
I need a 3D printer for my projects... not an old and buggy machine from 2017. So I decided to  start this adventure, while hoping to get a final result that will match my expectations. In this project I'll upgrade all the most important parts of my CR-10 V1 and, obliviously, I'll fix all problems that I'll encounter.
I'm now publishing the BOM, I'll later add a complete guide to upgrades here!
