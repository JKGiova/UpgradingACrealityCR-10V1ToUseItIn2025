# Upgrading A Creality CR-10 V1 To Use It In 2025
My old Creality CR-10 V1 wasn’t fitting my necessary, so I decided to start upgrading it. There were a lot of problems with the printer: the glass bed adhesion, the stringing that the printer made while printing, the low precision of movements, the faulty heat sensor of the hotend (this problem had a fix without changing the hotend so i didn't included it in the journal) and more. During the upgrading process, I made errors, so I had to fix them, like when I made a short circuit and the MOS bed didn't worked anymore. I hope this project could help a lot of people, that, just like me, have an old and buggy 3D printer laying around and want to upgrade it for using again.
