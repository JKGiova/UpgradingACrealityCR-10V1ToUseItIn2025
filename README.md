# UpgradingACrealityCR-10V1ToUseItIn2025
My old Creality CR-10 V1 wasn’t fitting my necessary, so I decided to start upgrading it. The first thing I’ve done was buying and installing a new PEI bed with better adesion than the old glass bed. During the installation I’ve made an error: I placed the magnetic sticker on the glass pane, and not on the heatbed. So now I have to order a new magnetic sticker and install it on the heatbed. Another upgrade I already made is the installation of a BL-Touch sensor. Basically is a sensor that permits to create a model of the bed to adjust its non-uniformity. For this sensor I’ve printed a custom support to hold it near to the nozzle. I also used a Raspberry Pi 3B+ to install and run Klipper, a firmware that basically makes the Raspberry, instead of the mainboard, do all calculations needed for printing for better precision. My first decision was to include the Raspberry into the 3D printer case, so I bought a power supply 12V to 5V for the Raspberry, a little fan kit to cool down the SBC and a female-to-male 20 cm ethernet cable to take the LAN from outside the case and connecting it to the Raspberry. I assembled all the components inside the 3D printer enclosure, I wired the power supply to the Raspberry and I wired the BL-Touch to the mainboard. This sensor has two parts: the sensor itself and a servo motor to move the probe to activate the sensor. The sensor itself is wired to the mainboard as Z-stop but the servo is connected through an adapter to the old buzzer pin. Once everything was assembled the printer didn’t work: basically I made a short, the Raspberry MicroSD was then corrupted and the heatbed MOSFET doesn’t work anymore. This is my actual situation: I replaced the Raspberry MicroSD with a new one so the printer itself works  but the bed heats up very slowly as the MOSFET output is 10.5V instead of 12V. Before knowing that the problem was the MOS, I did different hours (5+) of troubleshooting. All parts arrived, so I started installing them. I installed the new heatbed MOS module and verified succesfully that it works. I installed the silicone bed spacers and the new magnetic bed sticker. I also installed the new extruder but, while reinstalling the hotend and the BL-Touch I noticed that the BL-Touch didn't fit. So basically i have to design a mount for it, considering the extruder space. The new hotend arrived... but they sent me the wrong model, so also for it I have to design a mount. So I decided that I will design (in future) a complete hotend mount with BL-Touch support included. Apart from BL-Touch and the new hotend, everything else works, so i decided to close here the project.
